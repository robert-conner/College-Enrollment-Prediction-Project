## Description
The College Enrollment Prediction Project aims to assist universities in accurately forecasting student enrollments, facilitating better resource allocation and strategic planning. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project analyzes institutional data from colleges across the United States to uncover patterns and insights that influence enrollment numbers. By understanding these factors, universities can make informed decisions to optimize their admissions strategies. This was a challenging dataset that held numerous datapoints of missing information and required some feature engineering.
